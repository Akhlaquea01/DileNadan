										<h3><a href="attitude.html">Attitude</a></h3>

											Attitude refers to what a person thinks about his or her surroundings and the way in which he or she interacts with it. A person’s attitude can be understood, not only by their verbal stance, but also by their body language, expressions and other mannerisms.

Having a positive attitude brings about a positive change in one’s life.
